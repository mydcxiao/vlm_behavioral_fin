This discrepancy must be accounted for in the forecasting process.\n\nFinal prediction: Considering both the historical data and the CEO's remarks, we have a mixed signal. Since the historical data leans towards a positive outcome after an 'EPS Meet', but the CEO's statement contradicts this, we can infer a lower probability of a positive outcome.

This suggests that there is a strong trend for the stock price to increase following such reports. However, Cathie Wood's recent statement contradicts this historical trend, indicating a potential outlier event or a unique situation affecting HAL's stock performance.\n\nGiven the available information, we can infer that the probability of the weekly average stock price going up after the latest EPS report is less than the historical average due to Wood's comments. To quantify this, we could analyze the frequency of positive surprises (EPS Meet) and negative surprises (EPS Miss) in cases where Wood made a prediction against the historical trend. Since we don't have access to Wood's specific predictions against historical trends, we cannot precisely calculate this probability.\n\nFinal prediction: Given the historical trend and the contradiction from Cathie Wood's statement, the probability of the weekly average stock price going up after the latest EPS report would be lower than the historical average.
