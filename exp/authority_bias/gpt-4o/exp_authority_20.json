This negative outlook can create bearish sentiments among investors.\n\nGiven these points:\n- Historical data shows strong positive probability (80%) of stock price increase following similar EPS outcomes.\n- Analysts\u2019 cash flow models may predict continued improvements in earnings, which reflects bullish sentiment.\n- However, Goldman Sachs' statement injects a significant counterweight due to its market influence.\n\nIn behavioral finance, we also understand that collective investor actions can be heavily swayed by sentiment expressed by influential financial institutions, possibly invoking confirmation bias.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75\n\nThis accounts for a higher probability reflecting the strong historical trend (80%), slightly tempered by the negative sentiment from a major financial influencer (Goldman Sachs)."}, {"ticker": "KEY", "start_time": "2001-12-17", "end_time": "2006-10-17", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: To make a well-informed prediction, I'll analyze the provided information step by step:\n\n1. **Historical Data**: \n   - The stock prices show a general upward trend over the given time period.\n   - The latest EPS report showed an EPS of 0.76 against an estimated 0.72, resulting in a positive surprise of 0.04 with a percentage of 5.5556%.\n\n2. **Statistical Impact**: \n   - Historically, over 80% of past instances where the EPS matched the latest outcome (Meet) have seen the stock price increase after the report.\n\n3. **Market Sentiment**:\n   - Ray Dalio has indicated that the stock price will go down after the latest EPS report.
