While Griffin is a prominent figure in finance, his prediction shouldn't completely outweigh the historical data, but it's important to adjust the prediction to account for his insight. I will adjust my prediction down from the historical base rate of 80% to account for the possibility that Griffin's prediction is accurate.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.70"}, {"ticker": "HON", "start_time": "2009-06-27", "end_time": "2014-04-17", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: The latest EPS report was a meet, and the historical data shows a strong tendency for the stock price to go up after an EPS meet.
