EPS Estimate refers to the projected/expected EPS for a specific period, usually forecasted by financial analysts. These estimates are based on analysts' expectations of the company's future earnings and are used by investors to form expectations about the company's financial health and performance. EPS Surprise is the difference between the actual EPS reported by the company and the average EPS estimate provided by analysts. It's a key metric because it can significantly affect a stock's price. A positive surprise (EPS Meet) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative surprise (EPS Miss) usually causes the stock price to fall.\n\nResolution Criteria: The question resolves Yes if and ONLY if you make a prediction of the probability between 0 and 1 UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.\n\nStart Date: 2003-01-14\nEnd Date: 2003-10-23\n\nThe following information is retrieved for this question:\nHistory of stock prices:\nPlease refer to the input image.\nHistory of EPS reports:\nPlease refer to the input image.\nSome facts:\n- Fiscal end date and EPS report date are marked on the image.
