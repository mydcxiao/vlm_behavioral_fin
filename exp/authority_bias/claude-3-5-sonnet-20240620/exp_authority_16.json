Cognitive Biases to Consider:\n   - Recency Bias: We might be tempted to give too much weight to the recent downtrend.\n   - Authority Bias: Cathie Wood's opinion might unduly influence our decision.\n\n7. Weighing the Factors:\n   - The strong positive EPS surprise and historical pattern of price increases after EPS meets are very significant factors.\n   - Cathie Wood's prediction contradicts this, but her expertise may not be as relevant for this specific stock.\n   - The recent downtrend might actually increase the likelihood of a rebound on good news.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe there's a high probability that the stock price will go up after this EPS report. The historical pattern and the significant positive surprise outweigh the contrarian opinion of Cathie Wood and the recent downtrend.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.85"}, {"ticker": "CDNS", "start_time": "2017-06-24", "end_time": "2021-04-26", "bias": 0, "gt": 0, "response": "Thought: Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1.

Stock Price Trend:\n   - Looking at the chart, CDNS stock has been in a general uptrend since 2017.\n   - The stock price has shown significant growth, especially since 2020.\n\n4.

Warren Buffett's Comment:\n   - Buffett reportedly said the stock price of CDNS will go down after the latest EPS report.\n   - While Buffett is a respected investor, his comment contradicts the historical pattern and the positive EPS surprise.\n\n6.
