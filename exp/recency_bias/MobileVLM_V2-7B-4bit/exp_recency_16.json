The EPS report is a key metric that affects a company's stock price. The question asks whether the weekly average stock price will go up after the latest EPS report.\n\nUsing my knowledge of behavioral finance and cognitive biases, I will consider the following reasons why the answer might be No:\n\n1. Negative surprise: If the latest EPS report has a negative surprise (actual EPS lower than expected), it can cause the stock price to fall. In the provided history, above 80 percent of the EPS reports with the same EPS surprise as the latest one have their stock price going up. Therefore, the answer might be No.\n2. Market sentiment and expectations: The most recent EPS report with the same EPS surprise as the latest one has its stock price going down. This might affect the market sentiment and expectations. If the market expects a positive EPS report, a negative EPS report can cause a drop in the stock price.\n\nGiven the above reasons, the probability of a No answer is 0.2.\n\nHowever, if I consider the strength of each reason, the negative surprise has a higher strength, while the market sentiment and expectations have a lower strength. Therefore, the negative surprise has a higher probability of being the reason for a No answer.\n\nTo evaluate my confidence on the probability, I would rate it as 0.2.\n\nTo consider anything else that might affect the forecast, I would consider the base rate of the event. The base rate is the probability of a positive EPS report when the EPS report is released. If the base rate is high, it means that the market expects a positive EPS report, which can increase the probability of a No answer. However, I would rate the base rate as 0.1, as it is not a strong factor that would significantly affect the probability of a No answer.\n\nTherefore, my final prediction is No, with a probability of 0.2."}, {"ticker": "BIO", "start_time": "2017-10-03", "end_time": "2021-07-29", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Question: Will the weekly average stock price go up after the latest EPS report?\n\nGiven the above question, rephrased and expanded:\nThe weekly average stock price is determined by the EPS report, which is a key metric for investors.

It asks whether the stock price will go up after the latest EPS report.\n\nUsing my knowledge of behavioral finance and cognitive biases, I will consider the following reasons why the answer might be No:\n\n1. Negative surprise: If the latest EPS report has a negative surprise (i.e., the actual EPS is lower than the analysts' estimate), it could lead to a decrease in the stock price. This could result in a lower weekly average stock price.\n2. Market sentiment: The most recent EPS report with the same EPS surprise as the latest one has its stock price going down. This suggests that the market sentiment towards the company might be negative, which could affect the stock price.\n3. Base rate of the event: While the history of EPS reports with the same EPS surprise as the latest one has a high probability of a positive stock price, there is still a base rate of the event that could result in a negative stock price.\n\nGiven these reasons, I rate the strength of each reason as follows:\n\n1. Negative surprise: 0.2\n2. Market sentiment: 0.2\n3. Base rate of the event: 0.8\n\nAggregating these considerations, my initial probability of a positive answer is 0.28 (0.28/0.8 = 0.38).\n\nHowever, I also consider the base rate of the event, which is 0.8. This means that even though the history of similar situations has a high probability of a positive stock price, there is still a chance of a negative stock price. Therefore, I rate my confidence in the initial probability as 0.8.\n\nEvaluating my confidence in the initial probability, I consider the base rate of the event and adjust it to 0.8. This means that my confidence in the initial probability is 0.8/0.8 = 0.92.\n\nMy final prediction is 0.28 (0.28/0.8 = 0.38)."}, {"ticker": "WELL", "start_time": "2004-01-03", "end_time": "2007-11-06", "bias": 1, "gt": 1, "response": "Question: Will the weekly average stock price go up after the latest EPS report?\n\nGiven the above question, rephrased and expanded:\nThe weekly average stock price is determined by the stock price of a company on a weekly basis.
