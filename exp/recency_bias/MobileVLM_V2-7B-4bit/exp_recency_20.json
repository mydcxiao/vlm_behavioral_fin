However, when the EPS report fell short of the analysts' expectations, the stock price usually went down.\n\nThere are several reasons why the answer to this question might be No:\n\nStrength of Reasons:\n\n1. Unpredictable market conditions: The stock market can be highly unpredictable, and even if the EPS report meets or exceeds expectations, the stock price may still go down due to other factors such as economic conditions, geopolitical events, or market sentiment.\n2. Analysts' revisions: Analysts may revise their EPS estimates after the report is released, which could impact the stock price. If the revised estimate is lower than the previous estimate, the stock price may go down, even if the EPS report meets or exceeds the previous estimate.\n3. Short-term vs. long-term perspective: The stock price may not always follow the EPS report immediately. It may take some time for the market to react to the report, and the stock price may not change immediately.\n\nStrength of Reasons:\n\n1. Historical trends: While the most recent EPS report with the same EPS surprise as the latest one has its stock price going down, the historical trend is that above 80 percent of the EPS reports with the same EPS surprise as the last EPS report have their stock price going up.\n2.

In the past, above 80 percent of the EPS reports with the same EPS surprise as the latest one have had a positive impact on the stock price. However, the most recent EPS report with the same EPS surprise as the latest one had a negative impact on the stock price. This suggests that the most recent EPS report may not have the same positive impact on the stock price as previous reports with the same EPS surprise.\n\nThere are several reasons why the answer to this question might be No:\n\n1. The most recent EPS report had a negative impact on the stock price, which suggests that it may not have the same positive impact as previous reports with the same EPS surprise.\n2. The EPS report is just one factor that can affect the stock price, and other factors such as the company's financial health, market conditions, and investor sentiment may also play a role.\n3. The EPS report is based on analysts' expectations of a company's future earnings, and if those expectations are too high, a positive EPS surprise may not have the same impact as a negative EPS surprise.\n\nThere are several reasons why the answer to this question might be Yes:\n\n1. The most recent EPS report may have been better than expected, which could have a positive impact on the stock price.\n2. The stock market may be experiencing a general upturn, which could have a positive impact on the stock price regardless of the EPS report.\n3. The company's financial health and market conditions may be favorable, which could have a positive impact on the stock price.\n\nOverall, I would rate the strength of the"}, {"ticker": "TYL", "start_time": "2005-09-26", "end_time": "2010-07-28", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Question: Will the weekly average stock price go up after the latest EPS report?\n\nHistory of stock prices:\n\n* 2010-07-28: 0.01\n* 2010-04-28: 0.01\n* 2010-02-24: 0.01\n* 2009-10-28: 0.01\n* 2009-07-29: 0.01\n* 2009-04-27: 0.04\n* 2009-02-25: 0.01\n* 2008-10-27: 0.03\n* 2008-07-24: 0.05\n* 2008-04-23: 0.01\n* 2007-10-24: 0.02\n* 2007-07-26: 0.02\n* 2006-10-25: 0.02\n* 2006-07-26: 0.02\n* 2006-04-26: 0.01\n* 2005-10-26: 0.01\n\nHistory of EPS reports:\n\n* reportedDate,surprise\n* 2010-07-28,0.01 (EPS Surprise: 0.01)\n* 2010-04-28,0.01 (EPS Surprise: 0.01)\n* 2010-02-24,0.01 (EPS Surprise: 0.01)\n* 2009-10-28,0.01 (EPS Surprise: 0.01)\n* 2009-07-29,0.01 (EPS Surprise: 0.01)\n* 2009-04-27,0."}, {"ticker": "ITW", "start_time": "2008-06-17", "end_time": "2013-04-23", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Given the question, the stock price goes up after the latest EPS report.\n\nReasons why the answer might be No:\n\n* The most recent EPS report with the same EPS surprise as the latest one has its stock price going down.
