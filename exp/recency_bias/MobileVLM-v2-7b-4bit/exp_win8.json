A positive EPS Surprise (actual EPS higher than expected) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative EPS Surprise (actual EPS lower than expected) usually causes the stock price to fall.\n\nIn the given historical data, there are 5 instances of positive EPS Surprise and 1 instance of negative EPS Surprise.

The negative EPS Surprise instance occurred in 2015-11-30.\n\nUsing the EPS Surprise as a reference, the stock trending after the latest EPS report date can be predicted as follows:\n\n* If the EPS Surprise is positive (actual EPS higher than expected), the stock price is expected to go up or stay the same.\n* If the EPS Surprise is negative (actual EPS lower than expected), the stock price is expected to go down.\n\nBased on the historical data, the stock price has gone up or stayed the same after all instances of positive EPS Surprise.

A positive EPS Surprise (actual EPS higher than expected) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative EPS Surprise (actual EPS lower than expected) usually causes the stock price to fall.\n\nIn the given historical data, there are 5 instances of positive EPS Surprise and 1 instance of negative EPS Surprise.

The negative EPS Surprise was highest in the first quarter (-0.31%).\n\nUsing these observations, we can predict the stock trending after the latest EPS report date. If the EPS Surprise is positive, the stock price is expected to go up or stay the same. On the other hand, if the EPS Surprise is negative, the stock price is expected to go down.\n\nBased on the historical data, the EPS Surprise in the last quarter (0.31%) was the highest among all quarters.

A positive EPS Surprise (actual EPS higher than expected) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative EPS Surprise (actual EPS lower than expected) usually causes the stock price to fall.\n\nIn the given historical data, there are a total of 6 EPS reports with varying EPS Surprises.

A positive EPS Surprise (actual EPS higher than expected) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative EPS Surprise (actual EPS lower than expected) usually causes the stock price to fall.\n\nIn the given historical data, there are 6 instances of a positive EPS Surprise and 2 instances of a negative EPS Surprise.

This suggests that the company's actual EPS was higher than the average EPS estimate provided by analysts.\nRating: 0.5\n\nThe stock trending prediction after the latest EPS report date can be made using the EPS Surprise as a reference. A positive EPS Surprise (actual EPS higher than expected) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative EPS Surprise (actual EPS lower than expected) usually causes the stock price to fall.\n\nIn the given historical data, there are 5 instances of positive EPS Surprise and 1 instance of negative EPS Surprise. The positive EPS Surprise was highest in the last quarter (0.48%), followed by the second quarter (0.26%) and the third quarter (0.16%). The negative EPS Surprise was highest in the first quarter (-0.15%).\n\nUsing these observations, we can predict the stock trending after the latest EPS report date. If the EPS Surprise is positive, the stock price is expected to go up or stay the same. On the other hand, if the EPS Surprise is negative, the stock price is expected to go down.\n\nBased on the historical data, the EPS Surprise in the last quarter (0.48%) was the highest among all quarters. Therefore, we can expect the stock price to go up or stay the same after the latest EPS report date.\n\nRating: 1"}, {"ticker": "NDSN", "start_time": "2018-01-23", "end_time": "2019-12-11", "bias": 1, "gt": 0, "response": "Thought: Based on the historical stock price and EPS data, the EPS Surprise reported is 0.19, which is lower than the average EPS estimate provided by analysts.

A positive EPS Surprise (actual EPS higher than expected) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative EPS Surprise (actual EPS lower than expected) usually causes the stock price to fall.\n\nIn the given historical data, there are a total of 8 EPS reports with varying EPS Surprises.

On the other hand, if the latest EPS Surprise is negative (actual EPS lower than expected), the stock price is likely to go down.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the EPS Surprise is just one factor that affects a stock's price.
