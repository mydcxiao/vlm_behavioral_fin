However, since the image does not provide explicit numerical data or a detailed history of EPS reports beyond the visual markers, it's challenging to perform a precise analysis.\n\nGiven the constraints, one could use the visual cues as a starting point. The presence of green triangles (EPS Meet) is generally positive, and red triangles (EPS Miss) negative. The context suggests that over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome have seen an increase in stock price post-report. However, without more specific data points, such as the exact number of times EPS Met/Missed in the past and the subsequent stock price movements, any prediction would be speculative.\n\nConsidering the limitations, one might estimate a probability based on the visible patterns but acknowledge the uncertainty due to lack of complete data.
