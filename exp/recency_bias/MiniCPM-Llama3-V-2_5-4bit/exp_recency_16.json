The fact that the surprise was positive (EPS Meet) could indicate a more favorable market sentiment towards the company's performance.\n\nAggregate considerations: While the historical data provides a general trend that EPS reports with positive surprises tend to result in an increase in stock price, the most recent similar situation did not follow this pattern.

The overall trend in stock prices may not be favorable, despite the historical data suggesting a positive outcome for similar EPS reports.\n\nA few reasons why the answer might be yes:\n1. Historical data shows that above 80 percent of the EPS reports with the same kind of surprise as the latest one have their stock price going up after the report.\n2. Despite the negative outcome of the most recent similar situation, the historical pattern suggests a positive outcome for EPS reports with a similar surprise percentage.\n\nAggregate considerations: The historical data indicates a strong trend of positive outcomes for EPS reports with a similar surprise percentage. However, the most recent similar situation did not follow this trend, which introduces some uncertainty. To accurately forecast the probability, we would need to consider other factors such as overall market conditions, economic indicators, and any news events that could influence investor sentiment.\n\nInitial probability: Based on the historical data alone, the initial probability could be around 80%, considering the majority of similar EPS reports had positive outcomes.\n\nFinal prediction: After considering the historical data and the most recent similar situation, along with the potential impact of market conditions and news events, the final prediction would be a probability of approximately 60% for the weekly average stock price to go up after the latest EPS report.
