Historically, the stock price has gone up after EPS Meets over 80% of the time. However, most recently, the stock price went down after the last EPS Meet. While the overall historical trend is important, the recent price movement suggests a possible shift in market sentiment, potentially due to other factors not captured in the provided information.  Considering both the long-term trend and the recent data point, I would assign a probability slightly below the historical average to account for the recent downward pressure.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "FFIV", "start_time": "2008-12-22", "end_time": "2011-10-25", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: The latest EPS report was a meet, with EPS of 1.06 compared to an estimated 0.98.
