In over 80% of past cases with EPS beat, the stock price went up. However, most recently, the stock price went down after an EPS beat. This suggests that while an EPS beat is generally positive, the market might be experiencing a shift in sentiment. Considering both the historical trend and the recent exception, I will assign a probability slightly lower than the historical average.\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "EMR", "start_time": "2003-07-06", "end_time": "2007-05-01", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: The latest EPS report was a meet, and the stock price went down slightly.

This suggests that there may be other factors at play that are driving the stock price down, despite the positive earnings report. Investors may be concerned about the company's future prospects, or there may be broader market factors that are weighing on the stock price.
