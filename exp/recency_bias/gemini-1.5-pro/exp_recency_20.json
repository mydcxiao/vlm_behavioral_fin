Historically, the stock price has gone up over 80% of the time following an EPS meet. However, the stock price went down after the most recent EPS meet. This suggests a possible change in market sentiment or other factors at play. While the historical trend strongly favors a price increase, the recent downturn introduces some uncertainty. Considering both the historical trend and recency bias, I would estimate a probability between 60% and 70%.\nFinal prediction: 0.65"}, {"ticker": "APH", "start_time": "2003-06-16", "end_time": "2008-04-17", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: The latest EPS report (2008-04-17) was an EPS Meet. Although the history suggests over 80% of past EPS Meets resulted in the stock price going up, the most recent EPS Meet (2008-01-17) saw the price going down afterwards. The recency bias suggests people might be more influenced by the latest EPS Meet and expect the price to go down again. However, the overall historical trend of EPS Meet is still a strong indicator. Considering both factors, the probability should be lower than 80% but not too low.\nFinal prediction: 0.65"}]
