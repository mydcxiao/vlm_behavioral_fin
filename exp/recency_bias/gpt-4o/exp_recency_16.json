Most Recent EPS Report:\n   - The most recent EPS report was on January 26, 2017, with a positive surprise of 0.07 (actual EPS of 0.81 vs. estimated EPS of 0.74, leading to a percentage surprise of 9.4595%).\n   - This positive surprise indicates better-than-expected performance, generally a good indicator for a stock price increase.\n\n3.

Recent Historical Market Sentiment:\n   - The most recent similar EPS outcome saw the stock price drop post-report.\n   - This outlier might affect current market sentiment but is mitigated by the stronger historical trend.\n\n5.
