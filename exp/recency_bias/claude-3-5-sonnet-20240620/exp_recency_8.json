However, we should temper this slightly due to the most recent contrary example and general market unpredictability.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "HIG", "start_time": "2020-03-30", "end_time": "2022-02-03", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1.

Stock price chart:\n   - Looking at the chart, we can see that the stock price has been on an upward trend since the last fiscal end date (2013-09-30).\n   - This suggests positive momentum leading up to the EPS report.\n\n5. Historical EPS Meets:\n   - The chart shows several previous EPS Meets (green triangles), and in most cases, the stock price continued to rise or at least maintain its level after these reports.\n\n6. Magnitude of surprise:\n   - The latest EPS surprise (0.05) is relatively small compared to some previous surprises (e.g., 0.22 on 2013-07-29).\n   - However, it's still positive, which is generally viewed favorably by the market.\n\n7. Cognitive biases to consider:\n   - Recency bias might make us overweight the importance of the most recent EPS Meet that resulted in a price decrease.\n   - Anchoring bias might make us focus too much on the 80% historical success rate.\n\n8. Overall market conditions:\n   - While not explicitly stated, the general upward trend of the stock price over the given period suggests a favorable market environment.\n\nWeighing all these factors:\n- The strong historical pattern (80% success rate) is a significant positive indicator.\n- The recent upward trend in the stock price and the positive EPS surprise support a positive outlook.\n- The most recent contrary example and the relatively small surprise magnitude introduce some uncertainty.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would assign a high probability to the stock price increasing, but not as high as the 80% historical rate due to the recent contrary example and the relatively small surprise.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "MCO", "start_time": "2018-09-26", "end_time": "2020-07-30", "bias": 0, "gt": 0, "response": "Thought: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1.
