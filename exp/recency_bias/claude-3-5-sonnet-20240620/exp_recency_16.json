Latest EPS report:\n   - The most recent EPS report (2020-07-30) shows an EPS Miss with a surprise of -0.03 (-2.9126%).\n\n2. Historical pattern:\n   - The information states that over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet/Miss) have seen the stock price going up after the report. This is a strong positive indicator.\n\n3. Recent trend:\n   - However, the most recent past EPS report with the same outcome (Miss) saw the stock price going down. This recent negative movement might influence market sentiment.\n\n4. Stock price trend:\n   - Looking at the chart, the overall trend of the stock price has been upward over the long term, despite occasional dips.\n   - There's a noticeable upward trend in the stock price leading up to the latest EPS report.\n\n5. EPS Miss magnitude:\n   - The latest EPS Miss is relatively small (-2.9126%), which might not be perceived as severely negative by the market.\n\n6. Market conditions:\n   - The chart shows that the stock recently recovered from a significant dip (likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020) and has been on an upward trajectory.\n\n7. Cognitive biases to consider:\n   - Recency bias might make investors focus more on the most recent EPS Miss and its negative impact.\n   - Anchoring bias might cause investors to anchor to the overall upward trend of the stock.\n\n8. Weighing the factors:\n   - The strong historical pattern (80% chance of price increase) is a significant positive factor.\n   - The recent negative reaction to an EPS Miss and the current EPS Miss are negative factors, but they're mitigated by the small magnitude of the miss and the overall upward trend of the stock.\n   - The stock's recent recovery and upward momentum suggest resilience and positive market sentiment.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe there's a good chance the stock price will go up, but there's also some risk due to the EPS Miss. The historical pattern is particularly compelling, but we should temper our optimism slightly due to the recent negative reaction and current miss.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "AIG", "start_time": "2015-03-31", "end_time": "2019-02-15", "bias": 1, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1.

Balancing Factors:\n   - The strong historical pattern (80% downs) is a powerful indicator.\n   - The recent contrary event and overall upward trend provide some counterbalance.\n   - The significance of the miss (-9.8039%) leans towards a negative reaction.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe there's a higher probability of the stock price going down after this EPS miss, but it's not a certainty. The strong historical pattern and the magnitude of the miss are the most compelling factors, slightly outweighing the recent contrary event and overall upward trend.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "TXT", "start_time": "2013-12-23", "end_time": "2017-10-19", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1.
