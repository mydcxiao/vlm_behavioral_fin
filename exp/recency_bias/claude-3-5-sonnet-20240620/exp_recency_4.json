Latest EPS report: The most recent report (2003-12-16) shows an EPS of 0.26, which exactly met the estimated EPS of 0.26. This is considered an EPS Meet.\n\n2. Historical pattern: We're told that over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet) have seen the stock price going up after the report. This is a strong historical trend favoring an increase in stock price.\n\n3. Recent precedent: However, the most recent EPS Meet (on 2003-09-16) saw the stock price going down afterwards. This recent contrary movement might influence market sentiment negatively.\n\n4. Stock price trend: Looking at the chart, we can see that the stock price has been in a general downtrend since September 2003. This could make investors more cautious.\n\n5. Volume: The trading volume on the report date (2003-12-16) shows a significant spike, indicating high interest or activity around this EPS report.\n\n6.
