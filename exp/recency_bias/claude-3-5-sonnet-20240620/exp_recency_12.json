Balancing Factors:\n   - The strong historical pattern (80% chance of price increase) is a significant positive factor.\n   - The recent contrary movement provides some caution.\n   - The large positive surprise in the latest report is likely to be viewed very positively by the market.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe there is a strong likelihood of the stock price increasing. The historical pattern and the significant positive surprise outweigh the recent contrary movement.
