Although the long-term historical trend suggests that the stock price is more likely to go down after an EPS meet (over 80% of the time), the recent past case with the same EPS outcome saw the stock price going up.  Given the recency bias, where people tend to overweight recent events over past events, the market sentiment may be influenced by the most recent positive outcome.
