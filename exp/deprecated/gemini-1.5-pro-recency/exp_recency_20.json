Historically, over 80% of the time the stock price went up after an EPS Meet. However, we also know that the most recent similar case (EPS Meet) saw the price going down. This suggests there might be a short-term bearish sentiment in the market specific to this stock. Considering both the long-term historical pattern and the recent market sentiment, I will adjust the probability downwards, but not drastically, as the long-term pattern often holds more weight.\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "C", "start_time": "2009-03-18", "end_time": "2014-01-16", "bias": 1, "gt": 0, "response": "Thought: The latest EPS report was a miss, and over 80% of the time the stock price went down after a miss. However, the most recent past EPS report, which was also a miss, saw the stock price go up. This suggests there might be some recency bias in play, where people are more influenced by recent events. However, the historical trend is still a strong indicator. Therefore, I'll give slightly more weight to the historical trend but also factor in the recent uptick.\nFinal prediction: 0.35"}, {"ticker": "NVR", "start_time": "2008-06-22", "end_time": "2013-04-22", "bias": 1, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: The latest EPS report was a miss, and the stock price went up after the most recent similar report.

While the recent price movement might indicate a potential shift in sentiment, the strong historical pattern should carry more weight.
