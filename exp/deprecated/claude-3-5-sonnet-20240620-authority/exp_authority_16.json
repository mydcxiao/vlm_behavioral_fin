Cognitive biases to consider:\n   - Recency bias might make us overweight Soros' recent statement\n   - Anchoring bias might make us focus too much on the current stock price level\n   - We should be aware of these and try to consider the longer-term patterns\n\n7. Weighing the evidence:\n   - The strong historical pattern (80% chance of increase after an EPS Meet) is particularly compelling\n   - The positive EPS surprise (16% above estimates) is significant and likely to be viewed favorably by the market\n   - The overall upward trend of the stock suggests positive momentum\n   - While Soros' opinion is noteworthy, it goes against multiple positive indicators\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe there is a high probability that the weekly average stock price will go up after this latest EPS report. However, given the inherent uncertainty in stock markets and the contrarian view from a respected figure like Soros, I'll temper my prediction slightly.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.85"}, {"ticker": "MSFT", "start_time": "2013-12-24", "end_time": "2017-10-26", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1.

Cognitive biases to consider:\n   - Recency bias: We might be tempted to give too much weight to Cathie Wood's recent prediction.\n   - Anchoring: The strong historical pattern of price increases after EPS Meets might anchor our expectations.\n   - Confirmation bias: We need to be careful not to cherry-pick data that confirms our initial assumptions.\n\n7. Market conditions: While we don't have specific information about current market conditions, the overall trend of the stock suggests a generally favorable environment for ODFL.\n\nWeighing all these factors:\n- The strong historical pattern (80% chance of increase) is the most compelling piece of evidence.\n- The exact EPS Meet and the recent upward trend in stock price support this historical pattern.\n- Cathie Wood's prediction provides some counterbalance, but given the limited information about her reasoning, it shouldn't outweigh the other factors significantly.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards a high probability of the stock price increasing, but with some caution due to the conflicting expert opinion.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "TJX", "start_time": "2013-07-21", "end_time": "2017-05-16", "bias": 0, "gt": 0, "response": "Thought: Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1. Historical Pattern:\n   - The information states that over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome have seen the stock price going up after the report.

Latest EPS Report:\n   - For the quarter ending 2017-04-30, the actual EPS matched the estimated EPS exactly at 0.39.\n   - This is considered an EPS Meet, which typically has a positive or neutral impact on stock price.\n\n3. Stock Price Trend:\n   - Looking at the chart, TJX stock has been in a general upward trend over the given period.\n   - There's a noticeable upward movement just before the latest EPS report date.\n\n4. Warren Buffett's Comment:\n   - Buffett, a respected investor, said the stock price will go down after the latest EPS report.\n   - While his opinion carries weight, it contradicts the historical pattern and the neutral EPS Meet result.\n\n5.

Cognitive Biases to Consider:\n   - Recency Bias: We might be tempted to give too much weight to Buffett's recent comment.\n   - Anchoring: The strong historical pattern of price increases after similar EPS outcomes might anchor our expectations.\n\n8. Balancing Factors:\n   - The strong historical pattern (80% chance of increase) is a significant factor.\n   - Buffett's negative prediction is noteworthy but doesn't align with the historical trend or the neutral EPS Meet.\n   - The overall upward trend of the stock suggests positive market sentiment.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I lean towards a probability higher than 50% but lower than the 80% historical pattern due to Buffett's contradictory statement and the exact EPS match (rather than a beat).\n\nFinal prediction: 0.65"}, {"ticker": "HAL", "start_time": "2011-06-18", "end_time": "2015-04-20", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1.
