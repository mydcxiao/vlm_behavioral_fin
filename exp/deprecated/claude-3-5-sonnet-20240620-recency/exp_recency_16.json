This is a strong indicator favoring a price increase.\n\n3. Recent precedent: However, the most recent past EPS Miss (2020-04-29) saw the stock price going down after the report. This recent event might influence market sentiment negatively.\n\n4. Overall trend: Looking at the stock price chart, there's a general upward trend over the long term, despite short-term fluctuations.\n\n5. COVID-19 impact: The latest report falls during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused increased market volatility. This adds uncertainty to the prediction.\n\n6.

Previous EPS reports: There's a mix of Meets and Misses in the past, but the stock has generally trended upward despite these variations.\n\n8. Volume: The trading volume doesn't show any extreme spikes recently, suggesting no unusual market activity.\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- The strong historical pattern (80% chance of increase after a Miss) is the most significant factor.\n- The overall upward trend of the stock supports this.\n- The small magnitude of the Miss might not significantly impact investor sentiment.\n- However, the recent precedent of a price decrease after a Miss and the general market uncertainty due to COVID-19 add some downward pressure.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would lean towards a probability higher than 0.5 but lower than 0.8 to account for the recent contrary evidence and increased uncertainty.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.65"}, {"ticker": "AIG", "start_time": "2015-03-31", "end_time": "2019-02-15", "bias": 1, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1.

Volume:\n   - Trading volume seems relatively stable, with no unusual spikes right before the latest EPS report.\n\n7. Market conditions:\n   - While we don't have specific market data, the overall upward trend of the stock suggests a generally favorable market environment.\n\nConsidering all these factors:\n- The strong historical pattern (80% chance of price increase after an EPS Meet) is a very positive indicator.\n- The significant positive EPS surprise (27%) for the latest report is likely to be well-received by the market.\n- The overall upward trend of the stock and good EPS track record add to the positive outlook.\n- The only major negative factor is the price decrease after the most recent similar EPS Meet, but this is outweighed by the other positive factors.\n\nGiven the strong positive indicators, particularly the historical pattern and the significant EPS beat, I would assign a high probability to the stock price increasing. However, considering the recent contrary movement and general market unpredictability, I'll temper my forecast slightly.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.85"}, {"ticker": "ETR", "start_time": "2014-06-29", "end_time": "2018-04-25", "bias": 1, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1. Latest EPS report: \n   - The latest EPS report shows a miss. The actual EPS (1.16) was lower than the estimated EPS (1.28), with a negative surprise of -0.12 (-9.375%).\n\n2. Historical pattern:\n   - We're told that over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (in this case, a miss) have seen the stock price going down after the report.

Recent similar case:\n   - However, the most recent past EPS report with a similar outcome (miss) saw the stock price going up. This recent contrary movement could influence market sentiment.\n\n4.

Immediate pre-report trend:\n   - The stock price seems to be on a slight upward trend just before the latest report date.\n\n6.

Cognitive biases to consider:\n   - Recency bias might make us overweight the most recent similar case where the stock went up after a miss.\n   - Availability bias might make us focus too much on the visible ups and downs in the chart.\n\n8. Balancing factors:\n   - The strong historical pattern (80% down after a miss) is a powerful indicator.\n   - The significant magnitude of the miss adds weight to the likelihood of a price decrease.\n   - However, the recent contrary case and the overall upward trend provide some counterbalance.\n\nWeighing all these factors, I lean towards predicting a price decrease, but with some uncertainty due to the conflicting signals.
