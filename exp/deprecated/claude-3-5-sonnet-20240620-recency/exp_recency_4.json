Recent trend:\n   - The chart shows an upward trend in the stock price leading up to the latest EPS report.\n   - There's a sharp increase just before the report date, possibly due to positive expectations.\n\n4. Previous EPS reports:\n   - All EPS reports shown in the chart (2021-11-10, 2022-02-08, 2022-05-04) were \"Meets\" with positive surprises.\n   - After each of these reports, the stock price generally trended upwards.\n\n5. Most recent similar case:\n   - The most recent EPS Meet (2022-05-04) saw the stock price going down after the report.\n   - This could potentially influence market sentiment negatively.\n\n6. Volume:\n   - The trading volume seems to have increased slightly near the latest report date, indicating increased interest.\n\n7. Magnitude of surprise:\n   - The latest surprise (0.07) is larger than the previous surprises shown (0.02, 0.01, 0.03).\n   - This larger positive surprise could lead to a more significant positive reaction.\n\n8. Overall market conditions:\n   - We don't have information about the broader market, which could influence the stock's movement.\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- The strong historical pattern (80% chance of increase) is a significant positive indicator.\n- The larger magnitude of the surprise compared to previous reports is also positive.\n- The upward trend leading to the report and the consistent pattern of price increases after previous EPS Meets are encouraging.\n- The most recent similar case showing a price decrease is a concern, but it's outweighed by the longer-term pattern.\n\nConsidering all these factors, and accounting for some uncertainty due to potential market factors we can't see, I would estimate a high probability of the stock price increasing, but not a certainty.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.85"}, {"ticker": "CTAS", "start_time": "2003-11-17", "end_time": "2004-09-16", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. Latest EPS report: The most recent EPS report (2004-09-16) shows an EPS Meet, with the actual EPS matching the estimated EPS exactly (0.42). This is generally a neutral to positive sign.\n\n2.
