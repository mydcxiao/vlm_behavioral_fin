Latest EPS report: The most recent report on 2008-01-15 shows a significant EPS miss. The actual EPS (-19.9) was much lower than the estimated EPS (-10.32), resulting in a large negative surprise of -9.58 (-92.8295%).\n\n2. Historical pattern: We're told that over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (in this case, a miss) have seen the stock price going down after the report. This is a strong historical trend suggesting a high probability of the stock price decreasing.\n\n3. Recent precedent: However, the most recent past EPS report with the same outcome (miss) saw the stock price going up. This recent event could influence market sentiment positively.\n\n4. Stock price trend: Looking at the chart, we can see that the stock price has been on a significant downward trend in the months leading up to this latest report. This existing negative momentum could be exacerbated by the poor EPS report.\n\n5. Magnitude of the miss: The EPS miss is quite substantial (-92.8295% surprise). Such a large miss is likely to have a more significant negative impact on investor sentiment than a smaller miss.\n\n6. Market conditions: The overall market conditions in early 2008 were becoming increasingly volatile due to the emerging financial crisis. This broader context could amplify negative reactions to poor company performance.\n\n7. Cognitive biases to consider:\n   - Recency bias might lead some investors to focus on the most recent EPS miss that led to a price increase, potentially softening the negative impact.\n   - Anchoring bias might cause some investors to anchor to the previous stock price levels, resisting the downward pressure.\n   - Herding behavior might lead to a stronger-than-expected reaction as investors follow the crowd in response to the negative news.\n\nWeighing all these factors:\n- The strong historical pattern (80% chance of price decrease after an EPS miss) is the most significant factor.\n- The magnitude of the EPS miss is substantial, likely to reinforce the negative sentiment.\n- The existing downward trend in the stock price adds to the bearish outlook.\n- The broader market conditions in early 2008 were not favorable.\n- The recent contrary example (price increase after an EPS miss) and potential cognitive biases provide some counterbalance, but are likely outweighed by the negative factors.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, I estimate a high probability that the weekly average stock price will go down after this latest EPS report.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.85"}, {"ticker": "AIG", "start_time": "2004-09-21", "end_time": "2009-08-07", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1.

Historical pattern:\n   - The image shows that historically, EPS beats (green markers) generally led to stock price increases.\n   - We're told that over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome have seen the stock price going up after the report. This is a strong historical precedent.\n\n3. Recent trend:\n   - The stock price has been in a downward trend for most of 2008 and early 2009, but seems to have stabilized and started recovering in the months leading up to this report.\n   - There's a noticeable uptick in volume just before this latest report, which could indicate increased investor interest.\n\n4. Most recent similar case:\n   - The most recent EPS beat (green marker) before this one actually saw the stock price go down.
