On the one hand, the historical data strongly suggests that the stock price will likely go up after an EPS meet, with over 80% of past similar instances showing this trend.

This introduces a significant contradictory viewpoint. While Griffin's prediction shouldn't be taken as a certainty, it's important to acknowledge his expertise and the potential impact of his views on other market participants. Considering both the historical trend and Griffin's statement, I would adjust the probability downwards from the baseline 80% to account for the possibility of Griffin's prediction influencing the market. \n\nFinal prediction: 0.65"}, {"ticker": "ODFL", "start_time": "2019-09-24", "end_time": "2023-07-26", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: The latest EPS report was a meet, which historically has led to the stock price going up in over 80% of cases.
