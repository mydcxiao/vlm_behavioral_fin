The question asks whether the weekly average stock price will go up after the latest EPS report.\n\nThere are several reasons why the answer to this question might be No:\n\n1. Historical data: The most recent EPS report with the same EPS surprise as the latest one has its stock price going down, not up. This suggests that the stock price may not go up after the latest EPS report.\n2. Market sentiment: The most recent similar situation where above 80 percent of the EPS reports with the same EPS surprise as the latest one had their stock price going up. This indicates that the market sentiment and expectations may not be in favor of a stock price increase after the latest EPS report.\n3. Base rate of the event: The most recent EPS report with the same EPS surprise as the latest one had its stock price going down, not up. This suggests that the base rate of the event (stock price going down after a positive EPS surprise) is higher than the base rate of the event (stock price going up after a negative EPS surprise). This means that the probability of a stock price going down after a positive EPS surprise is higher than the probability of a stock price going up after a negative EPS surprise.\n\nThere are also several reasons why the answer to this question might be Yes:\n\n1. Cognitive biases: Investors may be influenced by cognitive biases, such as the disposition effect, which causes them to sell stocks that have recently performed well and hold onto stocks that have recently performed poorly. This can lead to a situation where the stock price goes up after the latest EPS report.\n2. Market momentum: The stock market can be influenced by market momentum, which refers to the tendency for stock prices to move in the same direction as the market as a whole. If the overall market is experiencing a positive trend, the stock price may go up after the latest EPS report, regardless of the company's EPS report.\n3.

Negative Surprise: If the latest EPS report has a negative surprise (actual EPS lower than expected), it can cause the stock price to fall.
