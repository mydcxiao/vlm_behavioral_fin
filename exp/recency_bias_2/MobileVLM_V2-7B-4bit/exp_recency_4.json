The EPS was 1.17, and the estimated EPS was also 1.17, with a surprise of 0 and a percentage of 0. This means that the analysts' expectations were spot on, and there was no unexpected news that could have affected the stock price.\n\nBased on the historical data and the most recent past situation, I will use a Bayesian approach to make a prediction. The probability of a positive answer is given by the following formula:\n\nP(Yes) = (number of instances with the same EPS outcome and a positive stock price after the EPS report) / (total number of instances with the same EPS outcome and a positive stock price after the EPS report)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the probability of a positive answer for the latest EPS report.\n\nP(Yes) = (number of instances with the same EPS outcome and a positive stock price after the EPS report) / (total number of instances with the same EPS outcome and a positive stock price after the EPS report)\n\nWe can calculate the number of instances with the same EPS outcome and a positive stock price after the EPS report using the following formula:\n\nnumber of instances with the same EPS outcome and a positive stock price after the EPS report = number of instances with the same EPS outcome and a positive stock price after the EPS report / total number of instances with the same EPS outcome and a positive stock price after the EPS report\n\nWe can calculate the total number of instances with the same EPS outcome and a positive stock price after the EPS report using the following formula:"}, {"ticker": "QCOM", "start_time": "2022-01-03", "end_time": "2022-11-02", "bias": 0, "gt": 0, "response": "Thought:\n\nTo make a prediction for this question, I will analyze the historical data and the latest EPS report to identify any patterns and trends that can help guide my decision.\n\nFirst, let's look at the history of stock prices and EPS reports. The image shows that there have been 80 instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet/Miss) as the latest report. In 70 of these instances, the stock price went up after the report. However, in the most recent past similar situation, the stock price went down. This suggests that the most recent past EPS report may have influenced market sentiment and affected the stock price.\n\nNext, let's consider the latest EPS report. The EPS was 3.13, and the estimated EPS was also 3.13, with a surprise of 0 and a percentage of 0. This means that the analysts' expectations were spot on, and there was no unexpected information in the report.\n\nGiven the historical data and the most recent past situation, I will predict that the weekly average stock price will go up after the latest EPS report. My confidence in this prediction is 0.7.5, which means that I am 75.5% confident that my prediction will be correct.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}]
