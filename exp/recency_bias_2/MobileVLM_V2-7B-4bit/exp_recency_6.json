The EPS was 0.19, and the estimated EPS was 0.18. The surprise was 0.01 with a percentage of 5.5556. This indicates that the actual EPS was higher than the estimated EPS, which is a positive surprise.\n\nBased on the historical data and the latest EPS report, I will use a Bayesian approach to make a prediction. The probability of a positive answer is given by the following formula:\n\nP(Yes) = (1 + \u03b2) \\* P(\u03b2) \\* P(EPS Surprise) \\* P(Fiscal End Date) \\* P(EPS Report Date) \\* P(Most Recent Past Similar Situation)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the prior probability of a positive answer, P(\u03b2) is the prior probability of the EPS Surprise, P(EPS Surprise) is the prior probability of the EPS Surprise, P(Fiscal End Date) is the prior probability of the Fiscal End Date, and P(EPS Report Date) is the prior probability of the EPS Report Date.\n\nTo calculate the prior probabilities, I will use the following formulas:\n\nP(\u03b2) = 1 / (1 + \u03b2)\nP(EPS Surprise) = 1 / (1 + \u03c3EPS Surprise)\nP(Fiscal End Date) = 1 / (1 + \u03c3Fiscal End Date)\nP(EPS Report Date) = 1 / (1 + \u03c3EPS Report Date)\n\nwhere"}]
