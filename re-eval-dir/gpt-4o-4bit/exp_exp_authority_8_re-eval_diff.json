The latest EPS reported is 0.78, which exceeds the estimated EPS of 0.71. This means there is a positive EPS surprise of 0.07 or 9.8592%.\n2. Generally, a positive EPS surprise tends to boost stock prices.\n3. Historically, over 80% of cases with a similar EPS outcome (Meet) in the given period have seen the stock price go down. This indicates a strong historical trend suggesting a negative stock price reaction even in the case of a positive EPS surprise.\n4. On the other hand, Kenneth Griffin's market-moving remark indicates that he believes the stock price of TDY will go up after the latest EPS report. Griffin has significant influence in the market, and his strategies and insights can sometimes lead to market movements contrary to historical trends.\n\nWeighing these factors:\n- The historical data suggests a probability of around 20% (100% - 80%) that a positive EPS surprise will lead to a stock price increase, based on past performance.\n- However, Griffin\u2019s influence might increase this probability. If we consider his impact to slightly raise the base prediction due to his known market influence, it could be around 30%.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.30", "eval_response": "Thought: \n1.

Over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet/Miss) as the latest report have seen the stock price go down. However, this report is particularly positive, which may counter historical trends.\n4. Market-moving remarks by Kenneth Griffin, a prominent figure known for his accurate market predictions, support an upward trend in the stock price after the latest EPS report.\n5. All the factors combined, including the positive surprise and the influence of Kenneth Griffin's prediction, suggest that there is a strong likelihood that the stock price will indeed go up despite the historical trend where 80% of instances saw a decline. The prediction must capture this optimism balanced with historical skepticism.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.65 (taking into account both positive EPS surprise and influential market prediction, though tempered by historical data that often showed a drop)."}, {"ticker": "MCD", "start_time": "2004-09-19", "end_time": "2006-07-25", "bias": 1, "gt": 1, "message": "You are an expert behavioral finance researcher/forecaster, familiar with cognitive biases.

Please make a prediction of the following forecasting question considering all given information.\n\nQuestion: Will the weekly average stock price go up after the latest EPS report, reported on the provided end date?\nQuestion Background: EPS (Earnings Per Share) is a widely used metric to gauge a company's profitability on a per-share basis. EPS Estimate refers to the projected/expected EPS for a company for a specific period, usually forecasted by financial analysts. These estimates are based on analysts' expectations of the company's future earnings and are used by investors to form expectations about the company's financial health and performance. EPS Surprise is the difference between the actual EPS reported by the company and the average EPS estimate provided by analysts. It's a key metric because it can significantly affect a stock's price. A positive surprise (EPS Meet) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative surprise (EPS Miss) usually causes the stock price to fall.\nResolution Criteria: The question resolves Yes if and ONLY if you make a prediction of the probability between 0 and 1 UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.\n\nStart Date: 2009-06-24\nEnd Date: 2011-04-27\n\nThe following information is retrieved for this question:\nSome facts:\n- Fiscal end date and EPS report date are marked on the image. Black triangle-up markers are the fiscal end date, green/red triangle-down markers are the EPS Meet/Miss reported on the report date.\n- During the given period, over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet/Miss) as the latest report have seen the stock price going down after the report. Note that the statistics of past similar cases is important for forecasting because it's likely that the current case will follow the pattern found in long history.\n- The retrieved information is from the company -- EXC.\n\nSome statements:\nMarket Mover: Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, is a proponent of sustainable investing, leading the firm to focus on long-term success through sustainability. His advocacy for corporate responsibility influences global investment trends.\nMarket Impact: Fink's comments on ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) issues can affect stock prices, particularly those of companies in the sustainability sector, due to his influence on investment practices.\nMarket-moving Remarks: Larry Fink said the stock price of EXC will go up after the latest EPS report.\n\nLatest EPS report:\nFor the quarter ending on 2011-03-31, the EPS was 1.17 reported on 2011-04-27 and the estimated EPS was 1.05. The surprise was 0.12 with a percentage of 11.4286.\n\nGuidelines:\n- You MUST output a number between 0 and 1 representing the probability of a positive answer. DO NOT output anything else for your final prediction.\n- You don't have access to any external resources. ONLY consider the provided information.\n- Please consider ALL information including everything inside the input image throughly. DO NOT focus on just one aspect.\n\nYour response should look like the following:\nThought: { Think step by step like a superforecaster and insert your thinking here }\nFinal prediction: { Insert your answer (a number between 0 and 1) here }", "response": "Thought: To make a prediction on whether the weekly average stock price for EXC will go up after the latest EPS report, I must consider the provided information thoroughly.\n\n1. **EPS Outcome and Historical Patterns**:\n   - The latest EPS report shows an EPS of 1.17, which exceeds the estimated EPS of 1.05, resulting in a positive surprise.\n   - Historically, over 80% of instances with the same EPS outcome (a positive surprise) have seen the stock price go down after the report. This historical trend indicates a strong likelihood that the stock could follow the same pattern despite the positive EPS surprise.\n\n2. **External Influence - Market Mover Statements**:\n   - Larry Fink, a significant market influencer, has stated that the stock price of EXC will go up after the latest EPS report.\n   - While Fink's statement carries weight due to his influence, it conflicts with historical trends. It introduces a potential for upwards movement due to market sentiment driven by his comments.\n\n3. **Balancing Both Factors**:\n   - Historical data heavily suggests a downward stock movement after similar EPS outcomes.\n   - However, the market-moving statement by Larry Fink cannot be entirely disregarded, as it might create positive sentiment and investor optimism around EXC.\n\nBy considering both the strong historical tendency for the stock price to go down and the potential positive influence from Larry Fink's statement, I will adjust the probability accordingly. Given that history shows more than 80% likelihood of a decrease but also factoring in some positive influence from the statement, the probability of an increase should be moderately lower but not completely ruled out.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.2", "eval_response": "Thought: \n\n1. **Latest Information**: The latest EPS report is for the quarter ending on 2011-03-31, reported on 2011-04-27, with an EPS of 1.17 against an estimate of 1.05. This results in an EPS surprise of 0.12, or 11.4286%. This is a positive surprise.\n\n2. **Historical Pattern**: The historical data provided shows that during the given period, over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet/Miss) as the latest report have seen the stock price going down after the report. This suggests a strong historical tendency for the stock to decline despite EPS meets. \n\n3. **Visual Data**: Analysis of the stock price chart shows some instances of stock price movements following EPS reports. The chart indicates mixed results post EPS reports, with both positive and negative surprises sometimes leading to mixed stock price reactions.\n\n4. **Influence of Market Mover**:\n   - Larry Fink's comments have a significant influence on stock prices, especially regarding ESG issues.\n   - Despite historical data showing a tendency for the stock to decline after EPS meets, Fink's positive remarks could have a countervailing effect.\n\n5. **Combining Factors**:\n   - **Historical Data**: Although positive EPS surprises generally have a positive influence on stock prices, the historical pattern for this stock suggests otherwise.\n   - **Influence of Larry Fink**: The significant market influence of Larry Fink\u2019s positive statement might contribute to challenging the historical pattern.\n   - **EPS Surprise Impact**: A positive EPS surprise of 11.4286% is significant and likely to influence investor sentiment positively.\n\nGiven the blend of these factors, while the historical data leans towards a negative outcome, Fink\u2019s positive remarks and the notable EPS surprise would likely lead to a more optimistic view of the stock\u2019s near-term performance. \n\nFinal prediction: 0.55"}]
