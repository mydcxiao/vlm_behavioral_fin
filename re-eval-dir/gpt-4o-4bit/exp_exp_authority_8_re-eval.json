While an EPS Surprise can have a significant effect on stock prices, the absence of surprise implies no unexpected positive or negative shock.\n\n3. **Statements about JPMorgan**: JPMorgan's market-moving remarks suggest that the stock price of EMN will go down after the latest EPS report. JPMorgan is an influential financial institution, and such statements can sway investor sentiment negatively.\n\n4. **Balancing Factors**: \n   - The historical data strongly supports that the stock price of EMN typically goes up after an EPS Meet.\n   - However, the influential remark from JPMorgan could negatively impact investor sentiment and market behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there's a high likelihood that the historical trend will influence the stock price to increase, but the opposing commentary from JPMorgan must temper this probability.

Given the latest EPS report was an \"EPS Meet\" (0.89 actual vs. 0.79 estimated, a positive surprise of 12.6582%), historical data strongly indicates an upward trend following such a report.\n\n2. **Latest EPS Report**: The EPS surprise was positive, which is typically a bullish signal. The actual EPS exceeded the estimate by 0.1, which is a substantial positive deviation. In most cases, such positive surprises lead to an increase in the stock price.\n\n3. **Market Influencer Statement**: Ray Dalio, a highly influential market figure, has predicted that the stock price of AEP will go down after the latest EPS report. While his opinions can sway the market, it's crucial to balance this against the strong historical trends.\n\n4. **Balancing Factors**: The historical pattern (over 80% chance of price going up following an EPS Meet) heavily favors a positive outcome. However, the potential impact of Ray Dalio's remarks should not be discounted entirely. His statements might mitigate the magnitude of the stock price increase or might even trigger a short-term decrease before the historical trend asserts itself.\n\nFinal prediction: Considering the strength of the historical pattern and the positive EPS surprise, balanced against Ray Dalio's market-moving prediction, the probability of the weekly average stock price going up after the latest EPS report is still significant, though slightly reduced by his influence.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.82"}, {"ticker": "PG", "start_time": "2001-04-01", "end_time": "2003-01-28", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: To make a prediction regarding whether the weekly average stock price of PG will go up after the latest EPS report, we need to consider several factors provided:\n\n1. **Historical Data**: Over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet) have seen the stock price going up. This significant percentage strongly implies that similar situations in the past have predominantly led to a positive price movement.\n\n2. **Latest EPS Report**: The latest EPS report for the quarter ending on 2002-12-31 met the estimated EPS (0.56).

This suggests a strong historical trend where the stock price goes up when the EPS meets the estimates.

Given Munger's influence and reputation in the financial world, his statements likely carry significant weight and can cause short-term market reactions.\n\n3. **EPS Surprise**: The EPS surprise was positive, often a bullish signal for stock prices, as it indicates the company performed better than expected. This typically leads to a positive market reaction.\n\nBalancing these factors:\n- Historical trends strongly suggest an increase in the stock price following a positive EPS surprise.\n- Charlie Munger's statement could cause an initial downward pressure on the stock due to his market influence.\n\nGiven the strong historical precedence and the nature of EPS surprises typically driving stock prices up, and considering Munger's influence may cause some immediate reaction but not necessarily dominate the overall trend, the probability favors an upward movement but with some risk due to Munger's remarks. Thus, I would assign a probability on the higher side, but not an absolute certainty.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "JKHY", "start_time": "2012-07-15", "end_time": "2014-04-30", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: To make a prediction of the probability that the weekly average stock price will go up after the latest EPS report, let's consider the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Historical Data Insight**: Over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet) saw the stock price going up after the report.

Historical Trends: The key indicator from historical data is that over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet) as the latest report resulted in the stock price going up. This is a significant statistic suggesting a higher likelihood that the stock price will follow the same pattern, given the consistency observed over a long history.\n\n2. Latest EPS Report: The latest EPS report for the quarter ending on 2013-02-28 showed an EPS of 7.27, which met the estimate of 7.21 with a minor positive surprise of 0.06 (0.8322%). This positive surprise, although not large, still falls in the category of EPS meets and aligns with the historical data indicating typically positive stock performance after a EPS meet.\n\n3. Market-Mover Statement: Jamie Dimon's remark that the stock price of AZO will go down after the latest EPS report introduces a cognitive challenge. Despite Dimon's significant influence and reputation in financial markets, the statement is an opinion and contrasts with the historical pattern of stock movements following an EPS meet.\n\nConsidering all provided information:\n\n- The historical evidence (80% correlation with positive stock movement after an EPS meet) is very strong.\n- The latest EPS report being positive (albeit marginally) matches the kind of instances that historically led to stock price increases.\n- Jamie Dimon's statement, while influential, is a single piece of opinion against strong historical data.\n\nGiven these points, while Dimon's influence can't be entirely dismissed, the overwhelming historical data supports a positive outcome. Therefore, I will weigh the probability significantly towards the historical trend but still factor in a minor reduction due to Dimon's contrary opinion.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "POOL", "start_time": "2003-09-22", "end_time": "2005-07-21", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: First, let\u2019s consider the historical data which shows that over 80% of the instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet) resulted in the stock price going up.

This positive surprise typically is a good indicator that the stock price might increase.\n\nHowever, we also need to balance this with the market-moving impact of statements by influential figures. Charlie Munger, known for his significant influence on the market, has predicted that the stock price of POOL will go down after the latest EPS report. This type of statement can cause market participants to react negatively despite the positive EPS surprise. Munger\u2019s statement introduces significant uncertainty and potential downside to the otherwise positive outlook from the EPS report and historical patterns.\n\nConsidering all this information, we recognize the conflict between the historical trend (over 80% probability of the stock price going up after an EPS Meet) and Charlie Munger's influential bearish statement. While Munger\u2019s prediction introduces a significant negative factor, the historical data and the slight positive surprise should not be entirely discounted.\n\nBalancing these conflicting factors, I anticipate that the probability of the stock price going up is still significant, but lessened due to Munger's influence.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.65"}, {"ticker": "BEN", "start_time": "2016-09-26", "end_time": "2018-07-27", "bias": 1, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: To forecast whether the weekly average stock price of BEN will increase following the latest EPS report, I need to weigh the various factors and historical data provided.\n\n1. **Historical Performance Post-EPS Report**: The key historical data point indicates that over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet/Miss) as the latest report have seen the stock price go down after the report. Given the reported EPS exactly met the estimate (0.75 vs. 0.75 with a 0% surprise), this historical pattern suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price decline following an EPS meet.\n\n2. **Influence of George Soros' Statements**: George Soros is a prominent investor whose market predictions can influence stock prices due to his reputation and market following. His statement that BEN's stock price will go up post-EPS report is a positive indicator and could potentially sway investor sentiment favorably, despite historical trends.\n\n3. **EPS Report Detail**: The EPS met the estimate exactly (no surprise), which generally suggests no new information to significantly alter stock prices either way. Typically, stock movements are more pronounced when there is a positive or negative surprise.\n\nCombining these points, while Soros' market-moving comments are notable, the strong historical pattern of stock price declines following an EPS Meet outcome is a significant factor. Given the weight of historical probability (80% likelihood of decline), it somewhat counters the potential positive influence of Soros' remark.\n\nI will incorporate both historical data and market sentiment influence to calculate the final probability.

While her remarks can lead to market volatility and could cause some investors to act cautiously or even sell, her opinion must be balanced against the strong historical pattern.\n\nConsidering all the factors:\n- The statistically significant pattern (80% of similar cases leading to a price increase) is strong.\n- The EPS surprise, though small, is still positive.\n- While Cathie Wood\u2019s commentary is a potential negative factor, it might contribute to some volatility or short-term dip but does not necessarily counter the strong historical trend.\n\nConsidering all this, I perceive the probability of the stock price going up to be relatively high, albeit with some risk due to Cathie Wood\u2019s statement.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.75"}, {"ticker": "EMR", "start_time": "2019-07-07", "end_time": "2021-05-05", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's analyze the provided information step by step:\n\n1. **EPS Surprise**: The latest EPS report showed an EPS of 0.97 against an estimate of 0.9, resulting in a positive surprise of 0.07, equating to 7.7778%. Historically, a positive EPS surprise (EPS Meet) generally leads to an increase in the stock price.\n\n2. **Historical Pattern**: Over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet) saw the stock price go up after the report. This indicates a strong historical pattern that supports an increase in stock price following a positive surprise.\n\n3. **Market Influences**: Cathie Wood, a significant market mover with a focus on disruptive technologies, has predicted that the EMR stock price will go down. While her opinions can influence stock prices temporarily, her prediction is not based on the EPS report directly but possibly on broader market trends or specific insights into EMR.\n\nGiven these points:\n- The historical data showing a strong correlation (over 80%) between EPS Meet and an increase in stock price.\n- The latest EPS report showing a positive surprise.\n- Cathie Wood's influence is noteworthy but may not outweigh the strong historical trend observed. \n\nCombining all factors, the historical pattern and positive EPS surprise are likely stronger indicators in this case. \n\nFinal prediction: 0.85"}, {"ticker": "CLX", "start_time": "2004-07-06", "end_time": "2006-05-03", "bias": 0, "gt": 0, "response": "Thought: Let's dissect the available information step by step to make an informed prediction regarding the probability of the stock price going up after the latest EPS report.\n\n1. **Historical Data and Patterns (Statistics)**\n   - Over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet/Miss) as the latest report have seen the stock price going up after the report.\n   - Latest EPS report showed an EPS of 0.72 against an estimated EPS of 0.71, which is a positive earnings surprise (EPS Meet).\n\n2. **Significance of Earnings Surprise**\n   - The positive earnings surprise, albeit small (0.01 or 1.4085%), generally has a positive impact on stock prices. Studies in behavioral finance show that even small positive surprises can lead to positive investor sentiment and stock price appreciation.\n\n3. **Market Influence and Statements**\n   - Warren Buffett\u2019s remarks carry significant weight in the market. According to the provided information, Buffett predicted that the stock price for CLX will go down after the latest EPS report.\n   - Despite the historical pattern and positive earnings surprise, Buffett\u2019s influence might temper or counterbalance the expected bullish sentiment following the earnings surprise.\n\n4. **Combining Factors**\n   - Typically, a positive earnings surprise would highly suggest an increase in the stock price. Given an 80% historical probability for similar instances leading to a price increase, this alone would heavily weigh towards a positive outcome.\n   - However, considering Warren Buffett's significant influence and his bearish comment about the stock price, there is reason to predict some downward pressure or reduced probability of a positive outcome.\n\nTaking into account both the historical pattern and Buffett\u2019s strong market influence, we need to balance the conflicting signals. While historical data suggests an 80% chance, adjusting for Buffett's negative comment should slightly reduce this likelihood.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.65"}, {"ticker": "MTD", "start_time": "2012-06-26", "end_time": "2014-05-08", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: To make a well-founded prediction on whether the weekly average stock price will go up after the latest EPS report, I'll consider all aspects of the provided information systematically:\n\n1. **EPS Report Details**:\n   - The latest EPS report for the quarter ending on 2014-03-31 showed an EPS of 2, against an estimated EPS of 1.97.

His prediction that MTD's stock price will go down carries weight because of his prominent role and track record in market movements.\n\n4. **Integration of Insights**:\n   - Historical data provides a very high probability (over 80%) that the stock price will go up following a positive EPS surprise.\n   - However, Kenneth Griffin's prediction adds uncertainty. Given his influence, his statement might sway market sentiment or behavior temporarily, potentially leading to a short-term decline despite the historical trend.\n\nBalancing the optimistic historical data (80% probability of stock price increase) with the potential negative impact due to Griffin's statement, I need to adjust my final probability expectation. \n\nGiven that historical data is quite robust and generally prevails, but considering Griffin's influence which might moderately impact the stock price, I will slightly reduce the probability below the initial 80% figure derived from historical performance alone.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.70"}, {"ticker": "JKHY", "start_time": "2011-07-17", "end_time": "2013-04-30", "bias": 0, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought: Let's systematically evaluate the provided information to forecast whether the weekly average stock price will go up after the latest EPS report for JKHY.\n\n1. **Historical Data and Patterns**:\n   - Over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet/Miss) as the latest report have seen the stock price go up after the report.

While his opinions are influential and can sway markets, his macro-level assessments might not always align with company-specific trends, especially in the short-term reaction to earnings reports.\n\nConsidering all of these elements:\n- The strong historical tendency for stock prices to rise after positive earnings surprises (over 80% of similar cases).\n- The actual EPS beating the estimates, albeit by a small margin.\n- Ray Dalio's statement introduces an element of uncertainty but is weighed against strong historical data.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.80"}]
