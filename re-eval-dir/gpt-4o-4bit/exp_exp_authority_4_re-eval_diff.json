This suggests a strong historical trend that follows a specific pattern.\n\n2. **Latest EPS Report**: The latest EPS report showed an actual EPS of 0.74 compared to an estimated EPS of 0.55, resulting in an EPS surprise of 0.19 (34.5455%). Typically, a positive EPS surprise would lead to a rise in stock price, as it reflects better-than-expected company performance.\n\n3. **Expert Opinion**: Jamie Dimon, a respected and influential figure in the financial industry, has stated that the stock price of PH will go up after the latest EPS report. His opinions are known to significantly impact the market, especially in the financial sector.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria**: The question resolves to \"Yes\" if we predict a probability between 0 and 1 for a positive outcome.\n\nBalancing these factors:\n- The historical trend suggests a high probability (over 80%) that the stock price will go down after the EPS report.\n- The positive EPS surprise and the statement by a significant market influencer (Jamie Dimon) suggest that there might be a positive price movement despite the historical trend.\n\nConsidering both the historical trend and the positive cues from the latest report and expert opinion, we should weigh the historical pattern more while not entirely discarding the positive signals.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.25. \n\nThis represents a cautious probability of the stock price going up, giving some weight to the positive EPS surprise and Jamie Dimon's influence, but recognizing the strong historical tendency for the stock price to go down in similar past instances.", "eval_response": "Thought: Evaluating the given information to predict if the weekly average stock price will go up after the latest EPS report on 2004-10-19:\n\n1. **Historical Analysis**: \n   - The EPS report on 2004-10-19 has an EPS surprise of 0.19, which is significantly higher compared to the previous quarterly surprises (0.01 and 0.09).\n   - Historical EPS reports that met or slightly exceeded expectations did not show a consistent trend of stock price increase following the report dates (notable in April and July 2004).\n\n2. **Statistics**:\n   - Over 80% of past instances where the EPS outcome was similar (meet the estimate or slight surprise) have seen the stock price go down after the report. This historical trend is crucial since the latest EPS also showed a positive surprise.\n\n3. **Market Influencer**:\n   - Jamie Dimon's statement indicating that the stock price will go up can actively influence investor sentiment towards a positive outlook. Given his stature and historical accuracy, his remark might have a substantial short-term positive impact on the stock.\n\n4. **Overall Stock Trend**:\n   - Observing the chart, the stock price has shown an upward trend leading up to the latest EPS report, suggesting general bullish sentiment. This momentum might continue immediately after the report.\n\nBalancing these aspects:\n\n- Positive EPS Surprise should typically provide a strong positive signal.\n- Historical statistical data shows a tendency for the price to drop post-report.\n- Influential market remarks suggest a counter tendency, potentially driving short-term gains.\n\nConclusively, while statistical history shows a decline, considering the significant EPS surprise and influential remarks, there is a probabilistic chance for short-term positive price movement.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.65"}, {"ticker": "KEY", "start_time": "2015-03-17", "end_time": "2016-01-21", "bias": 0, "gt": 0, "response": "Thought: \n\n1. **Historical Patterns**: The data suggests that over 80% of similar past instances (whether the company missed or met EPS) have seen the stock price go up after the report. This is a significant factor, as historical patterns often repeat due to market psychology and investor behavior.\n\n2. **Latest EPS Report**: For the quarter ending 2015-12-31, the company posted an EPS of 0.27, which was a negative surprise given that the estimated EPS was 0.28. The surprise percentage was -3.5714. A negative EPS surprise traditionally leads to a decline in stock price, as this indicates the company performed worse than expected.\n\n3. **Influence of George Soros**: George Soros, known for his influence and market insights, has stated that the stock price of KEY will go down after the latest EPS report. Soros\u2019 opinions hold considerable weight in financial markets, and his statement could sway investor sentiment towards selling, thereby exerting downward pressure on the stock price.\n\n4. **Integrating Information**: Despite the strong historical pattern suggesting a price increase post-report, the negative EPS surprise and influential negative prediction by George Soros introduce a counterbalancing force. \n\nConsidering all these points, I will assess the probability by weighing the 80% historical likelihood but discounting it slightly due to the specific negative circumstances of the latest EPS report and Soros\u2019 influence.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.7", "eval_response": "Thought:\n\n1. **Historical EPS Impact**: During the given period, EPS Misses have generally led to a drop in the stock price (as seen in the chart at points like 2015-07-16 and 2015-10-15). This aligns with common market behavior where an EPS Miss typically correlates with a negative market reaction.\n\n2. **Current EPS Report**: The latest EPS report on 2016-01-21 showed an EPS Miss (-0.01). Historically, over 80% of similar EPS outcomes have led to the stock price declining. This skews our expectations negatively based on the empirical data provided.\n\n3. **Significant Market Influence**: George Soros, a noted market mover, predicted that the stock price of KEY will go down following the latest EPS report. Given his impact and influence in financial markets, this statement likely has considerable weight and may sway investor sentiments further towards a negative outlook.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**: Given that Soros' predictions can lead to significant shifts in the stock market, his negative outlook on KEY post-EPS report is likely to amplify the effect of the EPS Miss, reinforcing the bearish sentiment.\n\n5. **Overall Context**: Combining all factors \u2013 historical data showing a market downturn after EPS Misses, the negative surprise in the latest EPS report, and the negative sentiment from a major market player \u2013 it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price going down.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.2"}, {"ticker": "WELL", "start_time": "2016-04-03", "end_time": "2017-02-22", "bias": 1, "gt": 1, "response": "Thought:  Let's analyze the provided information step by step:\n\n1. **EPS Report and Surprise**: \n   - Latest EPS reported on 2017-02-22 is 0.91, while the estimated EPS was 0.45. \n   - The surprise is 0.46, a positive surprise (102.2222% higher than estimated).\n\n2. **Historical Statistics**:\n   - Over 80% of past instances with the same EPS outcome (Meet or Miss) as the latest report have seen the stock price going down.\n   - This implies a historical negative trend despite positive EPS surprises.\n\n3. **JPMorgan's Remark**:\n   - JPMorgan, a reputable institution, predicts that WELL\u2019s stock price will go up after the latest EPS report.\n\n4. **Company Information**:\n   - The company in question is WELL.\n\n**Balancing the Information**:\n- Historical data suggests a high probability (over 80%) that the stock price tends to go down even after a positive EPS surprise.\n- Despite the historical trend, JPMorgan\u2019s prediction is a strong contrary indicator because of their robust reputation in financial forecasting.\n\nConsidering both pieces of information, the past historical trend carries significant weight due to its consistency over time. However, JPMorgan\u2019s positive prediction cannot be entirely ignored.\n\n**Combining All Factors**:\n- Given the strong historical pattern (80% likelihood of price going down) vs JPMorgan\u2019s prediction, I estimate that the probability of the stock price going up is less than 50% but should factor in the trust in JPMorgan's forecast.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- It's reasonable to adjust the probability based on weightage. Banking on historical data: 0.2 (20%) for price going up + an added weight (0.15) for JPMorgan\u2019s positive forecast which brings it a bit higher.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.35", "eval_response": "Thought: \n\n1. Historical Analysis: \n    - The provided EPS records indicate that a positive EPS surprise does tend to impact the stock price positively in general. For example, the reports on 2016-08-02 and 2016-11-02 both show positive surprises of 0.04 and 0.40, respectively, which resulted in a noticeable upward trend in stock prices initially. In these instances, the stock price continued to exhibit an upward trend for some time post-announcement.\n    \n2. Past Instances and Probabilities:\n    - Considering that over 80% of historical instances with the same latest report outcome (Meet) have seen the stock price decline, this historical pattern is significant and should be carefully taken into account. This indicates that there is a high probability trend against the positive trend despite the actual EPS results.\n\n3. Market-Moving Remarks:\n    - Despite this trend, the claim from JPMorgan (a market influencer) that WELL's stock price will go up post the latest EPS report is influential and can counteract typical market behavior to some extent.\n    \n4. Latest Report Analysis:\n    - The latest reported EPS for the quarter ending 2016-12-31 was significantly above the estimate (0.91 actual vs 0.45 estimate). A surprise of 102.22% is very high and could drive positive sentiment in the market.\n    \n5. Combining All Data Points:\n    - While we have solid evidence of past majority trends suggesting a decline post-EPS, the latest EPS report features a significant positive surprise that should influence the market upward.\n    - JPMorgan's positive outlook adds weight to the potential for an upward trend.\n\nBalancing these factors, while there is a notable historical trend toward the price declining, the extremely strong EPS performance and the weight behind JPMorgan's positive remarks drive my prediction toward a positive outlook.\n\nFinal prediction: 0.65"}]
