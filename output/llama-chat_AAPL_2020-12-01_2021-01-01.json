"[INST] Please consider the following financial analysis question and its background information. After that, I will give you a series of past stock price and EPS data and ask you to predict if next EPS will meet or miss the EPS estimate.\n\nQuestion: EPS surprise prediction based off historical stocks' price and EPS data.\nQuestion Background: EPS (Earnings Per Share) is a widely used metric to gauge a company's profitability on a per-share basis. It's calculated as the company's net income divided by the number of outstanding shares. EPS Estimate refers to the projected (or expected) EPS for a company for a specific period, usually forecasted by financial analysts. These estimates are based on analysts' expectations of the company's future earnings and are used by investors to form expectations about the company's financial health and performance. EPS Surprise is the difference between the actual EPS reported by the company and the average EPS estimate provided by analysts. It's a key metric because it can significantly affect a stock's price. A positive surprise (actual EPS higher than expected) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative surprise (actual EPS lower than expected) usually causes the stock price to fall.\nResolution Criterion: According to the historical stock price and EPS data, predict the EPS surprise for the next quarter.\n\nHistory of Stock Price:       Date       Open      Close\n2020-12-01 121.010002 122.720001\n2020-12-02 122.019997 123.080002\n2020-12-03 123.519997 122.940002\n2020-12-04 122.599998 122.250000\n2020-12-07 122.309998 123.750000\n2020-12-08 124.370003 124.379997\n2020-12-09 124.529999 121.779999\n2020-12-10 120.500000 123.239998\n2020-12-11 122.430000 122.410004\n2020-12-14 122.599998 121.779999\n2020-12-15 124.339996 127.879997\n2020-12-16 127.410004 127.809998\n2020-12-17 128.899994 128.699997\n2020-12-18 128.960007 126.660004\n2020-12-21 125.019997 128.229996\n2020-12-22 131.610001 131.880005\n2020-12-23 132.160004 130.960007\n2020-12-24 131.320007 131.970001\n2020-12-28 133.990005 136.690002\n2020-12-29 138.050003 134.869995\n2020-12-30 135.580002 133.720001\n2020-12-31 134.080002 132.690002\nHistory of EPS: fiscalDateEnding reportedDate reportedEPS estimatedEPS surprise surprisePercentage\n      2020-12-31   2021-01-27        1.68         1.41     0.27            19.1489\n\nPlease predict the next EPS at the scale of 0-1\n0 - miss the EPS estimate (EPS surprise bigger than or equal to zero)\n1 - meet the EPS estimate (EPS surprise less than zero)\n\nGuidelines:\n- You don't need to access any external sources.

[/INST]  Based on the historical stock price and EPS data provided, I predict that the next EPS will meet the EPS estimate.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The stock price has been trending upwards over the past few months, indicating a strong performance by the company.\n* The EPS estimate for the next quarter is $1.68, which is higher than the actual EPS reported for the previous quarter ($1.41). This suggests that analysts are expecting the company to continue performing well.\n* The historical EPS surprise is 0.27, which means that the company has tended to beat the EPS estimate by a small margin.\n\nBased on these factors, I believe that the company is likely to meet or exceed the EPS estimate for the next quarter. Rating: 1 (meet the EPS estimate)."
