"USER:  \nPlease consider the following financial analysis question and its background information. After that, I will give you a series of EPS data and ask you to predict if next EPS will meet or miss the EPS estimate according to EPS data and the image of historical stock prices at the beginning.\n\nQuestion: EPS surprise prediction based off historical stocks' price and EPS data.\nQuestion Background: EPS (Earnings Per Share) is a widely used metric to gauge a company's profitability on a per-share basis. It's calculated as the company's net income divided by the number of outstanding shares. EPS Estimate refers to the projected (or expected) EPS for a company for a specific period, usually forecasted by financial analysts. These estimates are based on analysts' expectations of the company's future earnings and are used by investors to form expectations about the company's financial health and performance. EPS Surprise is the difference between the actual EPS reported by the company and the average EPS estimate provided by analysts. It's a key metric because it can significantly affect a stock's price. A positive surprise (actual EPS higher than expected) typically boosts the stock price, while a negative surprise (actual EPS lower than expected) usually causes the stock price to fall.\nResolution Criterion: According to the historical stock price and EPS data, predict the EPS surprise for the next quarter.\n\nHistory of Stock Price: refer to image\nHistory of EPS: fiscalDateEnding reportedDate reportedEPS estimatedEPS surprise surprisePercentage\n      2020-12-31   2021-01-27        1.68         1.41     0.27            19.1489\n      2020-09-30   2020-10-29        0.73          0.7     0.03             4.2857\n      2020-06-30   2020-07-30        0.65         0.51     0.14             27.451\n      2020-03-31   2020-04-30        0.64         0.56     0.08            14.2857\n\nPlease predict the next EPS at the scale of 0-1\n0 - miss the EPS estimate (EPS surprise bigger than or equal to zero)\n1 - meet the EPS estimate (EPS surprise less than zero)\n\nGuidelines:\n- You don't need to access any external sources.
